            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The stakeholders of education, namely, governments, organisations and
                students themselves agree on its multidimensional essentiality. High-quality education, particularly
                tertiary education is a major catalyst of development in families across the income spectrum. Further,
                with the integration of multidimensional goals, the importance of education has accentuated and
                individuals have grown more conscious towards the environment and society developing an awareness
                lacking in previous generations. Published on the World Bank blog, the article “Education is Fundamental
                to Development and Growth” aptly summarises the fact that education, through various methods, carries
                the potential to transform people’s lives.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">On the flip side, a considerable number of individuals going through the
                varying levels of education, i.e, primary, secondary and higher education often tend to become detached
                from their studies and find it difficult to pinpoint their interests to further assess which fields suit
                their interests. Consequently, this results in the high dropout rates experienced in India.In this world
                of 7 billion people we need to educate all of them. this is the future of an educated world and we are
                proud to say that the Future of Education is here. our website ieducate provide more Services for our
                students ,we all provide best classes ,counselling ,infrastructure , enviournment etc. In this respect,

                for a stream/specialisation, job-related decisions and even emotional and financial support.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Distance learning, adult education and online education are all
                incremental steps towards highlighting the importance of education. With the growing need for access to
                quality education at one’s ease and comfort, many top colleges around the globe have included degree and
                non-degree study programs as part of their course offerings. Now, not only one can take topic-specific
                courses online but major degrees such as bachelor’s and masters can also be taken at one’s own pace.
                Further, a huge number of degrees have no restrictions related to age and background as well.</p>
